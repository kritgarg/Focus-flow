## Lessons Learned

While building FocusFlow, I gained valuable experience with various React libraries such as React Recharts, React Rewards, and UI component libraries like Daisy UI. One of the major challenges I encountered was deploying the app on Vercel. I discovered that the issue stemmed from routing problems in my app. To resolve this, I added a vercel.json file in the src folder and configured the routing settings within it, which successfully solved the problem.
